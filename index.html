        <h3 class="bg-warning">About Me</h3>
        <p>Born in the Philippines and raised in a culturally-diverse city just outside of Seattle,
          I've always been interested in the bigger picture and the intersections of different worldviews
          in shaping the future. Prior to starting <span class="school">Epicodus</span>, I had no knowledge
          and experience in the tech field and knew nothing about coding and programming. Awareness of coding
          and programming as a form of future literacy, I decided I wanted to develop the knowledge and skill.
          <span class="school"> Epicodus's</span> philosophy of making learning coding accessible to anyone, and the collaborative approach to learning drew me to the program. <strong>I hope to find a way to join a startup interested in the merging IT applications with social and environmental causes.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3 class="bg-warning">Interests</h3>
        <p>Along side learning how to code and program, my interests include social theories such:</p>

        <p><em>Systems Thinking, Intergral Theory, Spiral Dynamics, Holocracy</em></p>
